1. Application functionality and console interface menu

2. On startup, the app prompts you to start a new game or quit the app

3. When starting a new game, a word is randomly guessed, and the player begins the process of guessing it

4. After each entered letter we output the error counter, the current state of the gallows (drawn in ASCII characters) to the console
